The weather outside is terrible!
Today has been such a great day, I made it to all my classes on time, I got an 'A' on my exam, have already finished all of my home that is due until next week.
It looks like it will snow tomorrow
What's on the menu for Brooks today?
Allegheny College is such a great school to go to, I enjoy all my classes, especially computer science 112 with professor Kapfhammer, and am looking forward to having more courses with him!
Good morning
I hope the basketball team wins their game tonight.
The residence halls at Allegheny college include Ravine, Edwards, Crawford, College Court, The Allegheny Commons, Schultz, Brooks, Walker,  Baldwin, Caflisch, and both the  North Villages
